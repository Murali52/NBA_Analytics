# NBA_Analytics 
A novel physics-based features developed based on empirical on-court and injury daily bulletin data for injury and performance prediction. Data is sourced from multiple NBA API endpoints, CTG, NBA maps data for travel metrics, and Basketball-Reference to validate. 

Predictive Models including time-series models have been developed for fatigue, performance and injury prediction.

Additional Qualitative data has been augmented in the form of expert injury reports by muscoskeletal area of injury. Future work can augment this data for exploratory sequential research and to improve explainability with predictive models. The markdown files are added in an injury-expert-review folder in the repository.
