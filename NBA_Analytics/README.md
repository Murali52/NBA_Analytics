# NBA_Analytics
A novel physics-based features developed based on empirical on-court and injury daily bulletin data for injury and performance prediction. Data is sourced from multiple NBA API endpoints, CTG, NBA maps data for travel metrics and Basketball reference to validate.

Content highlights:
1.  Codes for data ingestion from NBA APIs, the official daily injury bulletin, CTG for Transition metrics, and NBA maps data for lat-long, elevation, and timezone information for travel processing are all included.
2. Fatigue Index, Player Performance Index, and Travel Stress Index were developed as novel interpretable features for analysis.
3. Statistical models (Chi-square, ANOVA), ML models for injury classification (XGB, RF) and SHAP / Feature_importance analyses are part of the analyses portfolio for injury prediction and factors identification
4. Time-series analysis for rolling (7-day and 14-day) cumulative fatigue index and averaged performance index predictions.
